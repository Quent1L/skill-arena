description: How players sign in, how invitation codes gate the instance, and how organizations scope a tournament to a group.

An instance is invite-only by default. This page covers the three pieces that decide who
gets in and what they can see: authentication, invitation codes, and organizations.

## Authentication

Accounts are backed by Better Auth, giving every player a secure login and every organizer
confidence that tournament data is tied to a real, authenticated identity.

Two authentication methods are supported, independently togglable per deployment:

- **Native email & password** — built in, no extra setup.
- **Keycloak SSO** — OIDC-based single sign-on through Keycloak, with optional PKCE.

Both can be enabled at the same time: players choose either method on the same login screen.
A Keycloak account automatically links to an existing native account that shares the same
email, so nobody ends up with duplicate accounts.

The variables that switch these on are listed in
[Environment Variables](/docs/environment-variables).

## Invitation codes

There is no open sign-up. Every account starts from an invitation code issued by the instance
administrator — a four-word passphrase like `frost-otter-ridge-plume`, easy to read out loud
or drop in a message.

Each code carries its own rules:

- **A number of uses** — one by default, or a larger batch for a whole team.
- **An optional expiry** — a code can run out after a set number of days, or never expire.
- **An optional organization** — bind a code to a group and redeeming it also makes the new
  player a member, so onboarding a private league is a single link.

There are three ways a code gets used:

- **At sign-up** — enter it on the registration screen, or follow a prefilled invite link that
  fills it in for you.
- **After signing in** — if an account was created without a code, the app asks for one before
  letting it in, rather than leaving a half-open account.
- **To join another group later** — an established player can redeem an organization-bound
  code from their settings to join an extra organization, without touching their account.

The gate applies to **every** login method: Keycloak SSO doesn't bypass it. Signing in through
your identity provider still leaves you on the code screen until a code is redeemed, so an
open SSO realm can't quietly become an open instance.

## Organizations

By default a tournament is public on the instance: anyone can browse it, follow the standings,
and read the match history — signed in or not. That's the right default for a community
ladder, and the wrong one for a company league or a private club.

Attaching an **organization** to a tournament makes it visible only to that organization's
members:

- **It disappears from the listing** for everyone else — non-members simply never see it.
- **The tournament itself is closed too**, not just hidden. Standings, matches, and entries
  are all refused to non-members, so a shared link leaks nothing.
- **Members keep everything else.** Belonging to an organization doesn't hide the public
  tournaments — you see the public ones _plus_ your group's.

A player can belong to several organizations at once, which is what makes one instance
workable for a company, its teams, and an open community side by side.

Organizations are created and their membership is managed by the instance administrator, who
also picks the organization when creating a tournament — leaving it empty keeps the
tournament public.
