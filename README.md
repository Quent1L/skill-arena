## What is Skol Arena?

Most competition tools are built around one idea: an organizer sets everything up, players
show up, scores get entered, the event ends. That works for a one-day bracket. It breaks
down when your competition lives across days or weeks, when players can't all meet at the
same time, or when your discipline doesn't fit a rigid format.

Skol Arena is built for those cases — clubs, communities, workplaces and local groups that
need competitions to stay flexible, credible and easy to run day after day. It is
**player-driven**: participants create and report their own matches, confirm or contest
results, and keep the competition moving without routing everything through one person.

It is **self-hostable** and ships as a single Docker image holding the API, the built web
app and its database migrations. You bring a PostgreSQL database and nothing else.

## Features

Three independent competition modes:

- **Championship** — flexible competitions that run over time. Persistent standings,
  configurable scoring, and fairness limits that stop a season-long championship from
  being gamed.
- **Bracket** — single or double elimination, losers bracket and bronze match. Draw at
  random, or seed the bracket from a finished championship's standings.
- **Ranked** — a continuous Elo-derivative MMR ladder with dynamic tiers, per-discipline
  team scoring, and instant feedback after every match.

Across every mode:

- **Player-driven match workflow** — create, report, confirm, correct, contest and cancel
  from the player side, with configurable validation levels per tournament.
- **Formats beyond 1v1** — solo, persistent team rosters, or teams assembled per match,
  with configurable team sizes.
- **Mobile-first and installable** — purpose-built mobile screens and a PWA, in French and
  English.
- **Access control** — native login or Keycloak SSO, invite-only registration, and
  organizations that scope a tournament to a group.

## Getting started

### Run an instance

```bash
docker run -d \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  -e DATABASE_URL='postgres://user:password@host:5432/skol_arena' \
  -e BETTER_AUTH_SECRET='a-long-random-string' \
  -e BETTER_AUTH_URL='http://localhost:3000' \
  quent1l/skol-arena:latest
```

Migrations run automatically at startup, and an initial super-admin account is created on
the first boot against an empty database — its generated password is printed to the
container logs.

### Develop

**Prerequisites:** [Bun](https://bun.sh) 1.3+ and an empty PostgreSQL 16+ database, owned
by a role allowed to create tables. Create it yourself — the app never creates its own
database:

```bash
createdb skol_arena
```

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Quent1L/skol-arena.git
cd skol-arena
bun install

cp backend/.env.example backend/.env   # set DATABASE_URL and BETTER_AUTH_SECRET

bun run dev                            # start every workspace
```

There is no separate migration step: the backend applies every pending migration at
startup, so the first `bun run dev` creates the schema.

|---|---|
| Backend (Hono + Bun) | http://localhost:3000 |
| Frontend (Vue 3 + Vite) | http://localhost:5173 |

## Contributing

Issues and pull requests are open. It is a real project used by real leagues, and it gets
better fastest when the people running them say what is missing.
