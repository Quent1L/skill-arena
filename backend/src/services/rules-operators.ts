/**
 * Custom operators layered on top of json-rules-engine's defaults.
 *
 * Two reasons they exist:
 *
 * 1. The stock `contains` / `doesNotContain` are declared with `Array.isArray` as
 *    their fact-value validator, and `Operator.evaluate` short-circuits on it. On a
 *    string fact they therefore always return false — no error, no warning — which
 *    makes `doesNotContain` read as the exact opposite of what it does. Both are
 *    redefined here to fall back to substring matching.
 * 2. The builder needs to compare a whole line-up against several players at once
 *    (`containsAll` and friends), which the stock single-value operators cannot do.
