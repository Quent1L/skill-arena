/**
 * Every award ranks on a single metric, and every tie runs down the same chain:
 * the season a player actually had — more matches, more wins, higher final MMR,
 * higher peak — and only then their id.
 *
 * Nothing in that chain reads an identity. Display names in particular are kept
 * out: they can be edited, and an award that moved because someone renamed
 * themselves would contradict the whole point of a snapshot. The id is a uuid
 * and settles nothing a player could recognise as fair; it sits at the very end,
 * present only to guarantee the order is total, since a chain that can still
 * return "equal" hands the award to iteration order. Determinism is not cosmetic
 * here — a rewind can be regenerated after an MMR recalculation, and the same
 * data must always crown the same player.
