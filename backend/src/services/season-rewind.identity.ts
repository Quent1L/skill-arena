/**
 * Repairing the names baked into a stored rewind.
 *
 * A rewind snapshots display names on purpose — it is never recomputed on read.
 * That makes it one more identity-denormalised cache: renaming a player, or
 * archiving them (which is a rename to `Archive N` plus the destruction of their
 * login), leaves the old name in every payload they appear in.
 *
 * The repair cannot be "regenerate": a rewind frozen at an older format must
 * keep that format. So instead of rebuilding a payload, this walks whatever
 * shape is stored and swaps the names in place. It only relies on identity refs
 * being `{ playerId, displayName, shortName }`, which is the one part of the
 * payload contract that has to stay stable across versions.
