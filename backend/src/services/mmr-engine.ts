/**
 * Pure MMR engine — no DB access, no side effects. Every MMR path (finalization,
 * provisional match preview, provisional leaderboard replay) calls this and this
 * only; they differ solely by the MMR snapshot they feed in.
 *
 * The engine separates three concerns the previous implementation mixed
 * together:
 *
 *   1. How expected the result was  → Elo on side averages → one player delta.
 *   2. How much MMR is at stake     → that delta × the side size, on even sides.
 *   3. Who carries which part of it → teamInteractionMode  → per-player shares.
 *
 * Scaling the pot by the side size is what makes a result worth the same to a
 * player whatever the format: in a 2v2 the pot is twice the Elo delta, each side
 * splits its own, and everyone moves by exactly what they would have moved in a
 * 1v1. It applies only when both sides field the same number of players — the
 * only case where both can scale by the same factor and still cancel out. Uneven
 * sides keep the plain pot of one Elo delta, split within each side, so nobody
 * ever risks more than their 1v1 delta.
 *
 * A match therefore transfers MMR between the two sides instead of creating it.
 * The losing side is settled first and whatever the MMR floor keeps a player from
 * paying is taken off the winners' pot, so the floor cannot mint MMR either. One
 * documented exception to that invariant remains: the per-player placement
 * multiplier.

/**
 * Bumped whenever a change to this file makes previously stored MMR
 * incomparable with what a new match would produce. Seasons still running are
 * replayed at boot to catch up — see `utils/init-mmr-engine.ts`.
 *
 * 1 — per-player ratio applied directly to the delta (non-conservative)
 * 2 — team delta split into normalised shares
 * 3 — pot scaled by the side size on even sides, so a 2v2 moves a player like a
 *     1v1; uneven sides keep the v2 split; the pot a floored player cannot pay
 *     is withheld from the winners instead of being minted
