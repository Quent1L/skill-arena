 * enum cannot be followed, in that same transaction, by anything using that
 * value. Postgres rejects it outright:
 *
 *   unsafe use of new value "ranked" of enum type tournament_mode
 *
 * An instance that upgrades release by release never hits this, because each
 * release brings a handful of migrations and the enum value was committed by an
 * earlier one. A brand-new deployment replaying the whole history from 0000 hits
 * it on the first boot and never starts.
 *
 * The trade-off is real and deliberate: a failure now leaves the migrations
 * before it applied. See the failure log below, which spells out where the
 * database stopped.
 *
 * The whole run is serialized across instances by an advisory lock, so several
 * replicas booting at once cannot interleave their migrations.
