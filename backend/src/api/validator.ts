/**
 * Request validation middleware, used everywhere in place of a direct
 * hono-openapi / @hono/zod-validator import.
 *
 * Two reasons it is wrapped rather than imported per route:
 *
 * 1. The schema is registered with the OpenAPI generator as a side effect of
 *    validating, so every documented request body and query string comes from the
 *    same declaration that enforces it — there is no second place to keep in sync.
 * 2. The failure hook. Left to its default, a validation failure answers with the
 *    validator's own `{ success: false, error, data }` shape, which is not the
 *    `{ error: { code, message, details } }` envelope every other failure uses and
 *    which the frontend interceptor reads. It also echoes the rejected payload back.
 *
 * The hook throws a BadRequestError rather than a ZodError on purpose. Zod 4's
 * exported `ZodError` does **not** extend Error — only the error `.parse()` throws
 * does — and Hono's compose rethrows anything that fails `instanceof Error` instead
 * of handing it to app.onError. A thrown ZodError therefore escapes the app
 * entirely and surfaces as a runtime crash page rather than an API error.
