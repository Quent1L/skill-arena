/**
 * A competition is not simply "editable" or "locked" once it leaves draft.
 *
 * Its title and its dates never weigh on a result and stay open forever. Its
 * scoring semantics can still be corrected as long as nobody has entered
 * anything. Its points scale can be corrected even later, at the price of
 * recomputing what has already been awarded. And its structure — mode, team
 * mode, discipline — is what every entered match was built on and cannot move at
 * all.
 *
 * This table is the single source of truth for that. The backend enforces it and
 * the frontend disables and explains from the same data, which is what stops the
 * two from drifting: there used to be three copies of the list and they
 * disagreed, so fields were rendered disabled that the API actually accepted.
